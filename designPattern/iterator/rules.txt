🔑 Critical C++ Rule (VERY IMPORTANT)

Template classes MUST be fully visible at compile time

👉 This means:

Template class definitions go in .h files

Do NOT put template implementations in .cpp

Non-template classes (Song, PlayList) can go in .cpp.


Interfaces are isolated

Templates stay header-only

Each folder = one domain concept

Creation responsibility decides file ownership

High-level code never includes low-level headers

#pragma once prevents multiple inclusions of a header file by ensuring it is included only once per compilation, avoiding redefinition errors and improving compile time."
#pragma once should be used only in headers file (.h) not in .cpp files
